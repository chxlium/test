3.8 Scoretize Algorithm: Dataset and Data Collection

3.8.1 Introduction

Scoretize's algorithm is a comprehensive and dynamic system designed to analyze, report, and deliver winning sales pitches based on the collected data set. It is built upon a foundation of cutting-edge technologies like generative AI, natural language processing, and own artificial intelligence algorithms. 

The application consists of three main functional components:

	Data Analytics: The algorithm processes and analyzes vast amounts of data to derive meaningful insights about a company's digital performance versus its competitors in the same industry and identifies opportunities for improvement that will be reflected in the sales pitch.

	Reporting: Based on the data analysis, the algorithm generates comprehensive and visually appealing reports that highlight key findings, trends, and actionable insights.

	Pitch Delivery: Leveraging generative AI, the algorithm crafts personalized and persuasive sales pitches that address pain points and offer tailored solutions based on the analyzed data and insights.

The high-level technical architecture of the product is depicted in the following diagram:
 
ETL development and Scoring Algorithms implemented in Python, backend is developed with Django and frontend implemented with Svelte.
The following WBS (work breakdown structure) diagram depicts the main functional components of the project and application:
 

One of the most advance features that Scoretize provides, is the fact that the user only has to enter a company’s URL which then triggers several data extraction and web-scrapping processes to fetch: social media accounts plus all of the real-time data that is listed in the following section in just a matter of minutes.

3.8.2 Data Analytics and Data Collection

The data analytics component of the algorithm is responsible for collecting, processing, and analyzing a variety of data sources, including the following sections and channels:

	Intent Data: Track and monitor top brands across industries and markets to identify business opportunities and pain points.
	Web Analytics: Analyze website performance, user behavior, and conversion funnels to uncover areas for optimization.
	SEO and Paid Media Analytics: Evaluate search engine rankings, paid media campaigns, and keyword performance to enhance visibility and reach.
	Social Media Analytics: Monitor social media engagement, sentiment, and trends to inform content strategy and brand positioning.
	Competitor Analysis: Benchmark performance against industry competitors to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for differentiation.

The data analytics component employs advanced AI techniques to process and analyze the collected data, identify patterns and correlations, and derive actionable insights. These processes are triggered every time a user creates a new project, they run on Azure functions and are orchestrated using Azure Data Factory to guarantee that the process executes succesfully and that data is consistent across all of the stages of the pipeline. This process can be split in three components:
EXTRACT
Process in which we extract data for each one of the channels, this is a combination of third-party APIs and internally developed web-scrapers. For example, Website metrics are extracted from a third-party API, while Social Media accounts and metrics are scrapped by our own processes and algorithms. 
SCORING ALGORITHMS
Proprietary algorithms that understand how each company is performing digitally compared to its main competitors, and then assign a score for each one of the channels, which then results in a Global Score that reflects each company’s overall digital performance. These algorithms are a combination of rule-based systems and Machine Learning models. The process is designed as follows:
1.	Using APIs from various services, we create a universal Dataset with metrics from companies of different sectors, evaluating several key areas: Traffic, SEO, Website-performance, social media, Paid Media.
2.	We developed an algorithm that assigns the importance (weights) of each of these metrics and calculates a global Score. We also calculate scores per channel and industry, which allows for specific actionable recommendations.
3.	Using this scored dataset, we train an ML model that learns the functional mapping that goes from input data (metrics), to output data (Score).
4.	For new unseen data (new companies), the ML model will predict the Score, compared to other global companies from the same industry.

LOAD
All the processes that push the gathered data to Blob storage, or a SQL server database, depending on the type of data and stage of the process.

Below a series of high-level diagrams that show the data flow and how the different extraction, scoring and loading modules interact with each other:

35.	Data Integration (ETL)
Date: 01/01/2022 - 05/03/2023
 
The data integration (ETL) component employs advanced AI techniques to process and analyze the collected data, identify patterns and correlations, and derive actionable insights. These processes are triggered every time a user creates a new project, they run on Azure functions and are orchestrated using Azure Data Factory to guarantee that the process executes successfully and that data is consistent across all of the stages of the pipeline. This process is the more complex and valuable one to our application, since all the data is fetched, processed and analyzed in it. This process can be split in three components:
1.	Extract
Process in which we extract data for each one of the channels, this is a combination of third-party APIs and internally developed web-scrapers. For example, Website metrics are extracted from a third-party API, while Social Media accounts and metrics are scrapped by our own processes and algorithms.
 
2.	Scoring Algorithms
Proprietary algorithms that understand how each company is performing digitally compared to its main competitors, and then assign a score for each one of the channels, which then results in a Global Score that reflects each company’s overall digital performance. These algorithms are a combination of rule-based systems and Machine Learning models. The process is designed as follows:

4. 	For new unseen data (new companies), the ML model will predict the Score, compared to other global companies from the same industry.
 
3.	Load
All the processes that push the gathered data to Blob storage, or a SQL server database, depending on the type of data and stage of the process.
 
Below a series of high-level diagrams that show the data flow and how the different extraction, scoring and loading modules interact with each other:
 
2.1 Pipeline Structure
The functions are called by pipelines of Azure Data Factory. These pipelines coordinate the functions and communicate with the backend of the Scoretize application. 
 
A.	Control Pipeline
 
The backend calls the "Control" pipeline which calls in turn the "Extract-Load" pipeline. Once said pipeline finishes, "Control" calls the "Score-Load" pipeline. After both pipelines have been successfully finished, "Control" calls a function to communicate to the backend that both pipelines have been executed successfully. In turn if the pipelines fail, a function will be triggered to communicate that the pipeline has failed.
Control passes the configuration dictionary that it has received from the backend to the functions and pipelines it calls.
 
B.	Extract-Load Pipeline
This pipeline calls the extract functions in the correct order. 
Each of these functions stores the extracted data in Azure Storage which is used as a staging layer, in a container defined by the dictionary the Scoretize backend sends to the pipeline (which are in turn passed to each of the functions called by the pipeline). The container name is defined in the dictionary in the key:value "container_name", and the folder will be the timestamp sent by the dictionary. 
Once all of the extract functions are done, the pipeline will call the "Load" functions. 
Each Load function has a particular domain (facebook, web data, social data, etc) and uploads ONLY to one table. 
These functions download the csv files from Azure Storage, check and clean the data to make sure to conform to the Schema of the Azure SQL table each data will be uploaded to, and then uploads the data in the table.
 
 
C.	Scoring-Algorithm-Load Pipeline
This pipeline calls the Score functions in the correct order. 
Each Score function has a particular domain (facebook, web data, social data, etc). 
Each of these functions downloads the relevant data from the SQL database (some functions will download data from different tables), performs the necessary calculations to get a score, and stores this score in Azure Storage. 
Once the Score function of each domain is executed, the "final score" function will be executed, and will retrieve all the scores from Azure Storage. 
When we finally have the final score the Load functions will upload all the scores to its corresponding tables.
  
2.2 Apis and Libraries

2.3 Next Development: Reputation
The next immediate phase that we are working on and that will be integrated to the application in the next months is: Reputation. This will be a section for the user to understand what is the perception that people have from any given company, in the following channels: YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Google News.
For this to happen, we reached an agreement with the Engineering & Mathematics department from the “Rovira i Virgili” university. This feature is currently under development. It is being implemented using Python and the following libraries:
-	Snscrape Library: https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape
-	TransformersLibrary: https://huggingface.co/transformers
-	GNews: https://pypi.org/project/gnews/
-	PyTube: https://github.com/pytube/pytube
-	ScrapeTube: https://github.com/zoreu/scrapetube
-	Google API: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client
 
The process is structured as follows:
Social Media
1. 	Based on the company’s domain (e.g., www.urv.cat), we are already extracting the Social Media accounts (E.g., www.facebook.com/universitatURV) for the following channels: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.
2. 	We then use do the following analysis:
·  	Use the links of the original URL to extract posts where the company has been mentioned.
·  	Use social media account links to extract interactions on the company’s posts. Ideally for all 4 channels.
3. 	Develop or use an already existing tool that performs Sentiment Analysis on the extracted text. The approach (dictionary, rule-based, NLP) is up to you.
4. 	Output: a numeric metric for Mentions, and another one for Posts, per Channel (ideally 8 metrics in total), that reflects if the reputation of the company on the social media source is perceived as positive or negative, and that is consistent across all companies being evaluated. E.g., a company with a good reputation may have a score of 92, whereas a company with a bad reputation would have a score of 37.
 
 
 
News
1. 	Based on the company’s domain (e.g., www.urv.cat), we should extract the company’s name (URV).
2. 	We then use the company name as a search term to extract news that are related to it, from Google News for example.
3. 	Develop or use an already existing tool that performs Sentiment Analysis on news’s text. The approach (dictionary, rule based, NLP) is up to you.
Output: a numeric metric that reflects if the reputation of the company on the news source is perceived as positive or negative, and that is consistent across all companies being evaluated. E.g., a company with a good reputation may have a score of 92, whereas a company with a bad reputation would have a score of 37.
Below a simple illustration that depicts the high level process for YouTube and Twitter:
 
 
2.4 Challenges
As we stated before, the Data Integration and Scoring process is the most relevant one and also the most complex of the application. Throughout the design and development stages, we have identified a series of challenges, some of which have been solved, some others are work in progress. Find below the most relevant ones:
 
36.	The process is technically complex and time consuming. We have managed to improve its performance significantly, but we still have some room for improvement that we will be addressing in the following sprints.
37.	We have a dependency on third-party APIs, which generates a risk of not being able to extract data points from tools that are temporarily unavailable or that have ceased their operations. In the period of December 2022 - January 2023, one of our main data providers deprecated the endpoint that we were using for most of the website metrics, which significantly impacted our development timeline and feature roadmap. 
38.	Each of the third party tools mentioned in the previous point has a cost, which impacts the profitability and business model of the tool, some of them are charged based on consumption which affects the economies of scale as well.
As next steps for points 2 and 3, we will be looking to find a backup data provider for each of the third party APIs, and in a latter stage develop our own solutions (as we have done for Social Media) for all of the metrics and sections to remove these dependencies completely.
 
 
3. Backend Development
 
Date: 01/11/2021 - 31/01/2023
 
Phase 1: DB Design and Creation
 
The database design for our SaaS product is a critical component of the backend development. Our team has chosen to use a relational database model using SQL Server, implemented through the Django framework.
  
 Our database consists of multiple tables, each with its own set of fields and relationships. The tables are normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve data consistency. We have also implemented appropriate indexing to optimize query performance.
	
	

 
Our database design is flexible, allowing us to easily add new data entities and fields as our product evolves. We have also implemented appropriate security measures, including encryption of sensitive data and user authentication.
 
Overall, our database design is a critical component of our SaaS product's backend development. It provides a robust foundation for our product, enabling us to deliver a high-quality user experience with efficient performance.
 
The creation of the DB has been made by Django, here is an example of how to create a table with code:
 
 
 
Phase 2: Django Settings
 
The settings define various aspects of the project, such as security, database connection, middleware, and application definition.
 
The code sets the SECRET_KEY and DEBUG variables from the environment variables using the os.environ method. It also sets the ALLOWED_HOSTS list, which specifies the domain names that can access the project.
 
The INSTALLED_APPS list defines the Django applications included in the project, such as django.contrib.admin, rest_framework, api.apps.ApiConfig, djoser, drf_yasg, and drf_spectacular.
 
The MIDDLEWARE list includes the middleware classes used by the project, such as django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware, whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware, and corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware.
 
The DATABASES setting specifies the database configuration for the project. It selects the appropriate database configuration depending on the value of the sys.argv list. If 'test' is in the sys.argv list, the project uses the database configuration from .databases.testDB, otherwise, it uses the database configuration from .databases.azureDB.
 
The AUTH_USER_MODEL setting defines the model used for authentication in the project, in this case, the api.Users model.
 
The REST_FRAMEWORK setting specifies the default authentication class used by the project, which is rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication, and the schema class used by the drf_spectacular package.
 
The SIMPLE_JWT setting configures the Simple JWT library used for authentication in the project. It specifies the token lifetime, the algorithm used for signing and verifying tokens, the authentication header type and name, and the token classes used for authentication. It also configures the cookie name, domain, and other options related to cookies.
 
 
Phase 3: API Creation
 
Endpoints link: https://scoretize-be-prod.azurewebsites.net/swagger/
 
One of the most essential components of a Django-based application is the API, which allows developers to interact with various parts of the application programmatically. In order to use the API, it is important to set up the database properly by running the necessary endpoints. Once this is done, users can register and login to access the application's various features.
  

 
For security purposes, the API requires authentication to access the "get data" endpoints. Users must log in to the system using their credentials to gain access. This ensures that sensitive information is only accessible by authorized users. 
 
Additionally, various validation mechanisms are in place to ensure that data inputted into the system is in the correct format.
 
Serializers are an essential part of the Django API framework, as they are responsible for transforming complex data into a format that can be easily transmitted over the network. They help ensure that data is in the correct format before it is stored or retrieved from the database. 
	
	

 
Validations are also important, as they ensure that data inputted into the system meets certain requirements, such as format, length, or content. This helps ensure the integrity of the data and the reliability of the system overall.
  

 
 
 
 
Phase 4: Unit Testing
 
After building the endpoints for my Django app, unit testing was added to ensure the functionality of the app remains intact as continuing to make changes. I created several tests to cover different aspects of the app.
 
Examples of Testing: 
	
	

 
 
One of the tests is the test_create_user() method, which creates a user and verifies that the user's email is correct, the user is active, and the user is not a staff member or superuser. The test also verifies that the username is None and that creating a user with no email or an empty email raises an appropriate error.
 
The test_create_superuser() method creates a superuser and verifies that the email, active status, staff status, and superuser status are all correct. It also verifies that the username is None and that creating a superuser with a false superuser flag raises an appropriate error.
 
Finally, the SearchAdsTestCase class has three methods: test_searchAds_score(), test_searchAds_score_evolution(), and test_searchAds_score_direct_competitors(). These methods test the search functionality of the app by sending requests to the server and verifying that the response status codes are correct.
	
	
 

By adding these unit tests, I can ensure that any changes I make to the app do not break its functionality, and I can quickly detect and fix any issues that arise.
Phase 5: CI/CD
 
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a widely used approach in software development that aims to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. In this technical text, we will explain how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a Django app to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions.
 
Azure App Service is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft Azure that enables developers to host web apps and APIs on Azure. GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool offered by GitHub that allows developers to automate their software workflows. The workflow we will be using consists of two jobs: build and deploy.
 
The build job sets up a Python environment, installs dependencies, and runs tests. If the tests pass, an artifact is created that contains the application code and its dependencies. The deploy job downloads the artifact and deploys it to Azure App Service.
 
The workflow is triggered whenever a pull request is closed on the "prod" branch. The "prod" branch is the main production branch for our Django app.
 
The first step in the build job is to check out the code from GitHub using the "actions/checkout" action. The next step sets up a Python environment using the "actions/setup-python" action and installs the required dependencies using "pip".
 
After the dependencies are installed, we can run tests if we want. This is an optional step, but it is good practice to have tests in place before deploying to production. If the tests pass, an artifact is created using the "actions/upload-artifact" action. The artifact contains the application code and its dependencies.
 
The deploy job downloads the artifact created in the build job using the "actions/download-artifact" action. The "azure/webapps-deploy" action is then used to deploy the application to Azure App Service. The action requires the name of the app, the slot name, the publish profile, and the path to the package. The publish profile is a secret that should be stored in the GitHub repository secrets.
 
In conclusion, setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a Django app to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions is a straightforward process. By automating the build, test, and deploy process, we can ensure that our code is always in a deployable state and ready to be shipped to production.
 
 
4. Frontend Development
 
Date: 01/05/2022 - 31/01/2023
 
The Frontend Development process involved several stages, starting with UX/UI design and testing, followed by frontend development, frontend and backend integration, testing and quality assurance, deployment, and maintenance.
 
Although Scoretize followed the above-mentioned steps for the development of the app's frontend, it's important to note that some of the steps happened in parallel at certain points in the process. This was particularly true once the main features of the app were developed and the team started working on improving and iterating them.
 
For example, while the design team was finalizing the design, the frontend development team was already implementing some of the functionality. 
 
Despite the parallel work, the teams maintained a strong collaboration and communication to ensure that the final product provided a consistent and user-friendly experience.
 
Phase 1: UX/UI Design and Testing
 
During the UX/UI design and testing phase, the team conducted extensive research to understand the target audience and their needs. Based on this research, they used Adobe XD to create wireframes and prototypes of the app's design and validated it through user testing. An example of one of the wireframes created using Adobe XD is provided below:
  

Flow view of app main screens in Adobe XD.
 
 
Detailed view of one of the main screens with UI specifications.
 
The feedback gathered from user testing was used to update the design, which was then transferred to the development team. Both the frontend and backend developers worked together to ensure that the design was consistent with the initial plan and met the standards of both the frontend and backend development.
 
After the development team completed their work, the design was finalized and aligned with the brand, adhering to UI and UX best practices.
 
Phase 2: Frontend Development
 
During the Frontend Development phase of Scoretize, the team developed the main structure and skeleton of each of the app's functionalities and views defined in the design. We achieved this by breaking down the app's features into smaller, reusable components using HTML, CSS, and the Sass preprocessor library.
 
For example, the following code snippet shows how the team has used Sass to define the main UI elements (colors, font size, font family, etc) as variables that were later reused to define the properties of component classes and component styles
 
 
Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that are included and used in other Sass files as well as Svelte files.
 
In addition to HTML, CSS, and Sass, the team also made use of Sveltekit as a JavaScript library for the frontend development. Sveltekit provided advanced features like server-side rendering, code splitting, and built-in support for single-page applications.
 
To further demonstrate the code structure used in Scoretize, the team split the code into "micro-frontends" or components. The following code structure screenshots exemplifies this approach:
  

Overview of the frontend code structure.
 
By leveraging these technologies and tools and utilizing a structured and reusable codebase, the team has been able to efficiently and effectively develop the frontend of the app. This approach allows for easier maintenance and future updates to the app's frontend.
  
Phase 3: Frontend and Backend Integration
 
The third phase of Scoretize's development involved integrating the frontend and backend to create a seamless user experience. This required developing a user access and management system using an authorization token system. The token is created and encrypted in the backend and sent in the request headers to the frontend once the user logs in. The token is kept in the browser's cookies and sent with every endpoint request as an authentication and authorization method.
 
To illustrate this process, the following code snippet shows how the frontend sends the user's login information to the backend, which then generates and sends the token back to the frontend:
  

Login page where the login API endpoint in the FE is called which calls at the same time the BE API endpoint that generates the token.
 
It's worth noting that the app has private and public views, which means that some pages require the user to be logged in to be seen, while others are open to any user.
 
In addition to the user access and management system, the team also integrated the database data through different endpoints that are linked to each project via each project ID and a specific timeline (by date and month range) that is defined in the endpoint params. By calling each specific endpoint, the frontend receives the data that needs to be formatted and displayed in different components, graphs, and maps to make sure the data is displayed in a user-friendly way.
 
To further illustrate this, the following code snippet shows how the frontend calls the traffic per country endpoint to retrieve project data:
  

This code snippet provides an example of how the frontend calls an endpoint to retrieve data from the backend while sending the necessary information: authorization token ('jwt'), project ID, and end date of the monthly range of data to be displayed.
 
To display the retrieved data in a user-friendly way, the team made use of two main graphs and maps libraries: ApexCharts, mostly for different types of graphs, and Leaflet, to display maps with data. The following code snippet shows an example of how the team used Leaflet to display the map graph:
 
Code snippet of the implemented Leaflet feature that displays data in a map.
 
Below, you can see how this code snippet and feature implementation is displayed in the frontend with a user-friendly and easy-to-read design:
  

The following screenshot displays how the data retrieved from the endpoint is being rendered on a graph component in the frontend of the app.
 
 
Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance
 
The testing and quality assurance phase is conducted every time a new functionality is implemented, changed, or improved in the app. These changes are deployed to the staging environment to be tested thoroughly before being released to the users.
 
During the testing phase, the team performs several rounds of testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues that may affect the user experience. The team also ensures that the app meets the requirements and specifications outlined during the design phase. The testing procedures include functional testing to verify that each functionality of the app works correctly as per the requirements, and usability testing to evaluate the user experience and interface of the app.
 
Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance
 
The frontend app has been deployed to Microsoft Azure as a Static Web App, which is a cloud service that enables developers to deploy and manage web applications and APIs.
 
To deploy the app, the team utilized GitHub workflows to connect the frontend GitHub repository to the Azure Static Web App instance. This connection enabled automatic deployments whenever there is a push to the main branch.
 
The team took advantage of several Azure services to meet the requirements for deploying the frontend app, such as:
 
1.	Azure Static Web App: This service is a fully managed platform for building and deploying static web apps. The team deployed the frontend app to Azure Static Web App to take advantage of its seamless integration with GitHub and automatic deployment features.

 
1.	Azure DNS: This service is a domain name system that translates domain names into IP addresses. The team used Azure DNS to map the app's domain name (app.scoretize.com) to the Azure Static Web App instance.

 

After the deployment, the team ensures that the app's frontend remains operational, secure, and up-to-date. On a regular basis, they perform various tasks such as fixing bugs, implementing new features, and updating software to maintain the frontend of the app.

 

 
1.	Objectives of the activity: 

 

The frontend app's main objective is to provide users with a user-friendly, easy-to-read, and visually appealing way to display extracted data. To achieve this objective, the development team together with the UX/UI team created different pages that display data from key marketing channels, including SEO, Paid Media, Social Media, and Website. Each view presents data from a selected main domain and its main online competitors - users can input up to 10 competitors. With all the global data extracted, the app calculates a score on each key area and an overall score, allowing the user to have a clear benchmark on the digital performance of the selected domain.

 

Collecting global data was a necessary step in this activity to have an overview of the digital performance of each of the input domains and compare them with each other. The global data also provides an overview of different key metrics and KPIs to the main user. The frontend app creates an all-in-one dashboard where companies, agencies, and end-users can analyze their main website domains' digital performance compared to the performance of their main competitors.

 

 
2.	Technical deviations and measures taken to correct them:

 

During the development of the frontend app, some technical deviations occurred, which were identified and addressed accordingly. Here are some of the deviations and the measures taken to correct them:

 
39.	Implementing new features simultaneously without being able to do the necessary rounds of testing before deploying them: Initially, the team was implementing new features concurrently, which resulted in a lack of proper testing before deployment. To correct this, the team decided to focus on one feature per sprint, dedicating sufficient time to testing the new features. This allowed the team to identify and fix any bugs or issues that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.
 
40.	Testing the application just in one browser, Google Chrome, and not in other ones like Safari, Firefox, etc.: At the beginning of the development, the team was testing the application only in one browser, which was Google Chrome. However, it was crucial to make sure that the app worked well across different browsers. As a solution, the team began to test the application in other browsers such as Safari, Firefox, and Edge, ensuring that the features were working as intended. This helped to make sure that the app was accessible to the maximum number of users, regardless of their preferred browser.
 
41.	Adapting the FE to new types of data extracted and handling edge cases when the BE or ETL will fail: The team encountered some issues while adapting the frontend to new types of data extracted, and handling edge cases when the backend or ETL failed. To address this, the team implemented error boundaries to ensure that the app would remain functional despite an error in a specific component. This approach helped to prevent the entire app from crashing in the event of an error, maintaining a better user experience.
 
By addressing these technical deviations and implementing the necessary measures, the team was able to deliver a high-quality frontend app that meets the requirements and specifications outlined during the design phase. 
 
3.	Conclusions regarding the implementation of the task:

 

The development team successfully achieved the main goal of the frontend app within the defined time. The app has all the main and most relevant views implemented and functioning. By creating a project, the user can have a benchmark of their digital performance and recommendations on how to improve the weakest metrics in less than 15 minutes.
